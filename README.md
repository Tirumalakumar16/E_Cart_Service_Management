1. Integrate with other microservices for user-related operations, such as billing, addresses, and orders.

#### User Session Management:

1. Manage user sessions securely, including session timeout and token refresh.


## Cart Service

#### Shopping Cart Management:

1. Implement the core functionality of adding, removing, and updating items in the shopping cart.
2. Support multiple carts per user, allowing users to manage different shopping lists.

#### Persistence:

1. Store cart data persistently to ensure that the user's cart contents are retained even if they log out or close their session.

#### User Authentication:

1. Integrate with the identity service to associate shopping carts with authenticated users.
2. Ensure that only the authorized user can access and modify their cart.


## Address Service

#### Address CRUD Operations:

1. Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for user addresses.
2. Allow users to manage multiple addresses and set a default shipping address.

#### Persistence:

1. Store address data persistently, ensuring data integrity and availability.

#### User Authentication:

1. Integrate with the identity service to associate addresses with authenticated users.
2. Ensure that only authorized users can access and manage their addresses.

#### Shipping Information:

1. Associate addresses with orders and shipping information.
2. Provide an interface for users to select a shipping address during the checkout process.

#### Privacy and Security:

1. Ensure that user address data is kept secure and complies with data protection regulations.

#### Scalability:

1. Design the Address Service to scale horizontally to handle increasing user loads and peaks in traffic, especially during high-demand periods.

## API Gateway 

#### Request Routing:

1. Route incoming requests to the appropriate microservices based on the requested endpoint or URL.
   
#### Load Balancing:

1. Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly among multiple instances of a microservice, ensuring high availability and improved performance.
#### Authentication and Authorization:

1. Enforce authentication and authorization checks for incoming requests, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific endpoints.

#### Security:

1. Secure the API Gateway against common web vulnerabilities, such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
2. Use security mechanisms like JWT tokens for secure communication with microservices.

#### Response Aggregation:

1. Aggregate data from multiple microservices to provide a unified response to the client, reducing the number of round-trips and improving performance.

#### Distributed Tracing:

1. Implement distributed tracing to track the flow of requests across microservices, making it easier to identify performance bottlenecks and troubleshoot issues.

#### Request Validation and Transformation:

1. Validate and transform incoming requests to ensure they meet the required format and standards for microservice consumption.

## Discovery Service

#### Service Registration:

1. Allow microservices to register themselves with the Discovery Service when they start up.

#### Service Deregistration:

1. Enable microservices to gracefully deregister themselves when they shut down or become unavailable.

#### Service Discovery:

1. Provide a mechanism for microservices to discover the location and availability of other services in the ecosystem.

#### Load Balancing:

1. Implement load balancing to distribute traffic evenly among multiple instances of a microservice, enhancing availability and performance.

#### Consistency and Availability:

1. Ensure the Discovery Service itself is highly available and consistent to avoid single points of failure.

#### Auto-Scaling Integration:

1. Integrate with auto-scaling mechanisms to automatically register and deregister instances based on scaling events.

#### Service Naming Conventions:

1. Establish clear naming conventions for services and their instances to facilitate easy discovery.
